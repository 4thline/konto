    <p>
        Many personal finance management tools are difficult to use. They try to hide the
        underlying account system with fuzzy terminology, complex UI, and then cover it all
        up with pretty charts. Don't be fooled, nice pie charts are meaningless when you
        really want to know where your money comes from, where it is invested, and how you
        are spending it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Konto is different. It embraces the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system">double-entry ledger</a>
        as its core engine and exposes it undiluted. Transaction entry and reporting become straightforward
        and accounting is no longer an obscure process. Konto is ideal for managing your personal finances,
        with a focus on actual numbers instead of decoration.
